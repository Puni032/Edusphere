## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Edusphere
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Start a local dev server at `http://localhost:5173`
- Open the application in your browser
- Enable hot reload for development

### Production Build

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist/` directory.

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint (when configured)
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Build Tool**: Vite (v5.0.0)
- **Canvas API**: For physics simulations and visualizations
- **Development**: ESLint, Prettier

## Learning Objectives

Students using EduSphere will learn:
- Newton's Three Laws of Motion
- Fundamental physics concepts (force, mass, acceleration)
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Basic programming through visual block coding
- Innovation and creative application of physics
